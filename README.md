# HTMLValidator
A HTML validator made from scratch using Java

This currently is available in CLI, using the pattern:
```ignorelang
java -jar HTMLValidator.jar <filename> [options]
```

Documentation will be created in the future, for now I could advise you to simply
put `-h` as a parameter and everything will be explained. 

I am currently working on a GUI version.
